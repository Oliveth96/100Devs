//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

movies = ['jumong','vincenzo','Empress ki']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

let movies = ['jumong','vincenzo','Empress ki']
let kDrama = movies[0]


//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

let KoreanMovies = movies.length
console.log(KoreanMovies)

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

let myMovies = movies[2]
